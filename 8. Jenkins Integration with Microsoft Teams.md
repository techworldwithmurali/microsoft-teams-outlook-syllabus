### Jenkins Integration with Microsoft Teams

* Microsoft Teams can be integrated with Jenkins using plugins or connectors to receive build notifications.
* Jenkins plugins like **"Office 365 Connector"** or **"Microsoft Teams Plugin"** allow Jenkins jobs to send build status messages directly to Teams channels.
* This integration helps development and operations teams stay updated on build progress without leaving Teams.

### Webhooks for Build Results

* Jenkins jobs can be configured to trigger webhooks that send HTTP POST requests with build information to Teams or an intermediary service.
* Webhooks carry payload data including build status (success, failure), job name, build number, and logs.
* Teams channels subscribed to these webhooks receive real-time updates on build completion and results.
* Allows automation of notifications and seamless communication.


### Alerting on Failed Builds

* Teams can be set to alert or notify users when a build fails or encounters errors.
* Alerts can include detailed messages with links to Jenkins build logs for quick troubleshooting.
* Teams users can react to alerts, start discussions, and coordinate fixes immediately.
* Ensures faster response times and better visibility into CI/CD pipeline health.
