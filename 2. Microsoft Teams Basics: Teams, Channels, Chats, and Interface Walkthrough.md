* Microsoft Teams is a collaboration platform designed to bring people, conversations, files, and tools together in one workspace.
* It integrates tightly with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, and SharePoint.
* Enables real-time communication via chat, meetings, calls, and file sharing.


### Use Cases for Software Development Teams

* Facilitates collaboration among developers, testers, and managers through organized channels.
* Supports code discussions, bug tracking, and project planning with integrations (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub).
* Enables seamless sharing and co-authoring of documentation and specs.
* Provides meeting spaces for stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.


### Teams vs Channels vs Chats

* **Channels**: Subsections within a team focused on specific topics, projects, or tasks. Channels can be standard (open) or private (restricted).
* **Chats**: One-on-one or group conversations outside of team channels for quick, informal communication.
